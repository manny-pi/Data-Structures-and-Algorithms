# Data Structures and Algorithms

Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
## Synopsis 
This repository contains common Data Structures and Algorithms that most Computer Science and Engineering enthusiasts will work with. 

## Content
At the time of writing, all of the programs are implemented in Java. I chose Java because of how well algorithms translate to its syntax, 
and how it allows you to see the nuances of the programs. 

I will likely implement add implementations for these programs in C, C++, and Python later on, as the repo grows. So stick around! 

## Resources 
I'm grateful for the Computer Science community because literally ALL of the information that you need to gain a VERY good grasp of 
the structures I implement are on the internet for free! 

As the repo grows, I'll add more resources, but for now, these are my primary sources for information that I used to build this repo
